History
-------

Initial version of **GENie** is fork of Premake 4.4 beta 5, and there is no
intention to keep it compatible with it.

## Changelog (since fork)

 - Added vs2013 support.
 - Added hash UUID support. `os.uuid(<string>)` should produce consistent UUID.
 - Added search for default script. Default script name is changed to genie.lua
   (solution.lua and premake4.lua are also allowed), and it can be located in
   `scripts` directory.
 - Updated Lua from 5.1.4 to 5.3.0.
 - Disabled `SmallerTypeCheck` VS option when `ExtraWarnings` is set (need to
   move it into separate option).
 - New versioning scheme based on revision number from git.
 - Added `startproject "<project name>"` to set default project in VS.
 - Removed `NoMinimalRebuild` and added reversed logic to `EnableMinimalRebuild`.
 - Added `NoMultiProcessorCompilation` flag to disable multiprocessor
   compilation in MSVC.
 - Added ability to configure Visual Studio toolset from GENie script.
 - Added `UnsignedChar` flag to force char to be unsigned.
 - Removed vs2002, vs2003, vs2005, Solaris, and Haiku support.
 - Allow source files in the same project to have the same name. Added 
   `SingleOutputDir` flag to use single output directory (original behaviour).
 - Added WinRT support (Windows Phone 8.1, Windows Store, Universal Apps).
 - Added `removeflags`, `removelinks`.
 - Added vs2015 support.
 - Added `targetsubdir`.
 - Added support for solution folders `group`.
 - Added `options` section (and `ForceCpp` to enforce C++ compile even if
   extension is for C files)
 - Added `msgcompile`, `msgresource`, `msglinking` and `msgarchiving` as
   overrides for make messages.
 - Added `messageskip` list to disable some of compiler messages.
 - Added `buildoptions_c`, `buildoptions_cpp`, `buildoptions_objc` for
   configuring language specific build options.
 - Split functionality of `excludes` in `removefiles` and `excludes`. With VS
   `excludes` will exclude files from build but files will be added to project
   file. `removefiles` removes files completely from project.
 - Added support for generating PS4/Orbis projects.

## Why fork?

At the time of writing this, September 2014, Premake project is on long hiatus.
The last official release 4.3 is released in November 2010, 4.4 beta 5 was
released in November 2013, and the main developer is focusing on Premake 5.

Multiple requests for releasing new version end up with this type of [answer](http://industriousone.com/topic/premake-release-neglect-becoming-critical):

	Then help fix the bugs marked 4.4 in the SourceForge tracker so that we can
	make a release. Or review and improve the patches so that I may get them
	applied more quickly. Or pay me to do it so that I can spend more time on
	it, instead of doing other work that you value less (but which actually, you
	know, pays me).

So author has high expectations for release, but he is not working on it, but
rather working on completely different... Pay me to finish this sentence...
You get the point. :)

This long period between releases where multiple versions are in flight cause
confusion for users who are not familiar with Premake, and they just need to
use Premake to generate project files for project they are interested in.

I've been using Premake for [a while](https://web.archive.org/web/20120119020903/http://carbongames.com/2011/08/Premake),
I really like it's simplicity, and that it does one thing really well.

I was considering replacing Premake with other build systems that also could
generate project files, but all these projects fail at being simple and doing
only one thing. I don't need build system, or package manager, etc. just a
simple project generator.

In conclusion, forking it and maintaining it is not much different from current
state of Premake, it's just acknowledging the problem, and dealing with it.
