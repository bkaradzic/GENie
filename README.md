[GENie](https://github.com/bkaradzic/genie#what-is-it) - Project generator tool
===============================================================================

What is it?
-----------

**GENie** (pronounced as Jenny) is project generator tool. It automagically
generates project from Lua script, making applying the same settings for
multiple projects easy.

Supported project generators:
 * FASTBuild (experimental)
 * GNU Makefile
 * Ninja (experimental)
 * Qbs / QtCreator (experimental)
 * Visual Studio 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017
 * XCode

History
-------

Initial version of **GENie** is fork of Premake 4.4 beta 5, and there is no
intention to keep it compatible with it.

## Changelog (since fork)

 - Added vs2013 support.
 - Added hash UUID support. `os.uuid(<string>)` should produce consistent UUID.
 - Added search for default script. Default script name is changed to genie.lua
   (solution.lua and premake4.lua are also allowed), and it can be located in
   `scripts` directory.
 - Updated Lua from 5.1.4 to 5.3.0.
 - Disabled `SmallerTypeCheck` VS option when `ExtraWarnings` is set (need to
   move it into separate option).
 - New versioning scheme based on revision number from git.
 - Added `startproject "<project name>"` to set default project in VS.
 - Removed `NoMinimalRebuild` and added reversed logic to `EnableMinimalRebuild`.
 - Added `NoMultiProcessorCompilation` flag to disable multiprocessor
   compilation in MSVC.
 - Added ability to configure Visual Studio toolset from GENie script.
 - Added `UnsignedChar` flag to force char to be unsigned.
 - Removed vs2002, vs2003, vs2005, Solaris, and Haiku support.
 - Allow source files in the same project to have the same name. Added 
   `SingleOutputDir` flag to use single output directory (original behaviour).
 - Added WinRT support (Windows Phone 8.1, Windows Store, Universal Apps).
 - Added `removeflags`, `removelinks`.
 - Added vs2015 support.
 - Added `targetsubdir`.
 - Added support for solution folders `group`.
 - Added `options` section (and `ForceCpp` to enforce C++ compile even if
   extension is for C files)
 - Added `msgcompile`, `msgresource`, `msglinking` and `msgarchiving` as
   overrides for make messages.
 - Added `messageskip` list to disable some of compiler messages.
 - Added `buildoptions_c`, `buildoptions_cpp`, `buildoptions_objc`,
   `buildoptions_objcpp`, `buildoptions_asm`, `buildoptions_swift` for
   configuring language specific build options.
 - Split functionality of `excludes` in `removefiles` and `excludes`. With VS
   `excludes` will exclude files from build but files will be added to project
   file. `removefiles` removes files completely from project.
 - Added support for generating PS4/Orbis projects.
 - Fixed PCH race when using concurrent Makefile build.
 - Added Green Hills Software compiler support.
 - Added edit & continue support for 64-bit builds in VS2013 upwards.
 - Added `windowstargetplatformversion` to specify VS Windows target version.
 - Added `NoWinRT` flag to disable WinRT CX builds.
 - Added `NoBufferSecurityCheck` flag to disable security checks in VS.
 - Added `nopch` file list to exclude files from using PCH.
 - Added `EnableAVX` and `EnableAVX2` flags to enable enhanced instruction set.
 - Added FASTBuild (.bff) project generator.
 - Added Vala language support.
 - Added MASM support for Visual Studio projects.
 - Added `userincludedirs` for include header with angle brackets and quotes
   search path control.
 - Detect when generated project files are not changing, and skip writing over
   existing project files.
 - Added Ninja project generator.
 - Added ability to specify MSVC "Old Style" debug info format with
   `C7DebugInfo`.
 - Added some support for per-configuration `files` lists.
 - Removed `clean` action.
 - Added support for QtCreator via Qbs build tool.
 - Added .natvis file type support for Visual Studio.
 - Added Swift language support for make and ninja build generators.
 - Removed CodeBlocks and CodeLite support.
 - Added vs2017 support.

Debugging GENie scripts
-----------------------

It is possible to debug build scripts using [ZeroBrane Studio][zbs]. You must
compile GENie in debug mode

    $ make config=debug

This ensures the core lua scripts are loaded from disk rather than compiled
into the GENie binary. Create a file named `debug.lua` as a sibling to your
main `genie.lua` script with the following content:

    local zb_path = <path to ZeroBraneStudio>
    local cpaths = {
        string.format("%s/bin/lib?.dylib;%s/bin/clibs53/?.dylib;", zb_path, zb_path),
        package.cpath,
    }
    package.cpath = table.concat(cpaths, ';')

    local paths = {
        string.format('%s/lualibs/?.lua;%s/lualibs/?/?.lua', zb_path, zb_path),
        string.format('%s/lualibs/?/init.lua;%s/lualibs/?/?/?.lua', zb_path, zb_path),
        string.format('%s/lualibs/?/?/init.lua', zb),
        package.path,
    }
    package.path = table.concat(paths, ';')

    require('mobdebug').start()

**NOTE:** update `zb_path` to refer to the root of your ZeroBrane Studio
install. For reference, you should find `lualibs` in you `zb_path` folder

To debug, make sure ZBS is listening for debug connections and add
`dofile("debug.lua")` to `genie.lua`
